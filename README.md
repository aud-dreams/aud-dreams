## Hello I'm Audrey Nguyen ðŸŒ¸

I'm a Junior pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at UC Irvine, with a specialization in intelligent systems. I am cultivating my interests in full-stack development, data science, and machine learning. I enjoy participating in hackathons during my free time, and exploring the intersection between learning analytics and gamification through EdTech research.

I'm open to internships and other opportunities! Feel free to contact me at audrehn3@uci.edu
