## Hello I'm Audrey Nguyen ðŸŒ¸

As a senior-standing Computer Science major at UC Irvine, I am cultivating my interests in full-stack development, data science, and machine learning. I enjoy participating in hackathons during my free time to push the limits of my creativity and develop my skillset. Currently, I am exploring the intersection between data science and learning analytics through research, and looking forward to pursuing Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in graduate school.

I'm open to internships and other opportunities! Feel free to contact me at audrehn3@uci.edu
